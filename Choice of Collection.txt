Choice of colletion class: TreeMap
Rationale:
1.	A TreeMap class can be used to store a History class variable of my application sorted by date with corresponding Subscriptions. 
The History class keeps a record of when my application sent a notification to the user. 
Using a TreeMap class would allow me to keep track of which Subscription was notified on which date. 
The key would be a History variable, and the value would be a Subscription variable.
I want to keep my history objects in a descending order.
The TreeMap class allows me to keep the list of history object sorted. There is no need to sort my objects
whenever an object is added or deleted. This could help the performance of my application.
